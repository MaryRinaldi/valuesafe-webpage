<!-- ### Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`.
- `cd client` and run `npm install`. This will install client dependencies (React).

### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called facebook: `create database project`
- Add a `.env` file to the project folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user like this:

```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=valuesafe_db
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
```

- Run `npm run migrate` in the project folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create two tables called 'users' in your database.

- Make sure you understand how the `users` table is constructed. In your MySQL console, you can run `use project;` and then `describe users;` to see the structure of the users table ( the same is about the other tables).

### Development

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 3000
- In another terminal, do `cd client` and run `npm run dev` to start the client in development mode with hot reloading in port 5173.
